# The Local Choice

The Local Choice is a web platform built to connect and raise awareness of vibrant local small businesses. With the support of our local community, we aim to inspire individuals to plant their seeds and grow their ideas. This project was created using a combination of modern web technologies, including Material UI, Framer Motion, the MERN stack, Redux for state management, JWT authentication for user security, and it's hosted on Cyclic.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**

  - Material UI: A popular React UI framework for building responsive web applications.
  - Framer Motion: Used for adding smooth animations to the user interface.
  - Redux: For managing the application's global state.
  - JWT Authentication: Ensures secure user authentication and authorization.

- **Backend:**

  - MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js are the core technologies for building a full-stack web application.

- **Hosting:**
  - Cyclic: The website is hosted on the Cyclic platform, ensuring high availability and performance.

## Approach

Our approach was to create a user-friendly platform that promotes local businesses and encourages community support. We focused on clean and intuitive UI design, smooth animations, and robust security using JWT authentication. The MERN stack was chosen for its flexibility and ability to handle real-time data updates efficiently.
